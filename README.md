* **Dev practices:** Git, CI/CD, Code review, writing documentation and runbooks


## 🚀 Selected Projects (high-impact)

Here’s what I’ve built that I’m truly proud of 👇

### Logs Fetcher — FastAPI + S3 (Support Tooling)

* Built backend endpoints to fetch, filter and stream application logs from S3 for faster troubleshooting.
* **Impact:** Reduced median log retrieval time from \~30–40 minutes to **20–25 seconds**.
* **Tech:** Python, FastAPI, AWS S3, React (frontend integration).
* **Why it matters:** Enabled one-click log downloads, inline previews and faster incident resolution for support engineers.

### Support Escalation Virtual Assistant — [Kore.ai XO11](https://platform.kore.ai)

* Developed a Virtual Assistant to accept and automate customer escalations and workflows.
* Integrated with Zendesk, JIRA, and Google Chat for end-to-end automation of escalations.
* **Tech:** Kore.ai XO11, Kore.ai WebSDK, Python (backend), Botkit.

### Developer Automations & Productivity Tools

* Built multiple generative-AI-powered automations that improved team productivity (search, triage, and automated replies).
* Authored 20+ knowledge-base articles and developed JIRA dashboards (JQL) to improve ticket triage/prioritisation.


## 🏆 Impact & Recognition

* Successfully handled and resolved **900+ tickets** and contributed to resolving **600+ complex runtime issues** across the platform.
* Received multiple internal Spotlight recognitions for automation and high-impact troubleshooting.
* Led trainings and knowledge-sharing sessions to elevate team capabilities.


## 🔬 How I approach engineering problems

1. **Understand the user & failure mode** — talk to users or operators, reproduce the issue.
2. **Measure** — gather telemetry, logs, and clear SLOs to quantify the problem.
3. **Prototype fast** — small, testable PoCs to validate ideas (local + cloud).
4. **Ship with observability** — metrics, logs, traces and clear runbooks.
5. **Iterate** — monitor performance and iterate based on real usage.
